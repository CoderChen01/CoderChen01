# Hi there, I’m Junjie (Jorji) Chen (陈俊杰) 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I am currently a third-year master’s student at Anhui Polytechnic University (AHPU), under the supervision of Prof. Subin Huang.

I am a Research Intern at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center, supervised by Prof. [Meng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rHagaaIAAAAJ&hl=en), where I will be joining as an incoming PhD student (Fall 2026). I am also a Research Assistant working with [Linfeng Zhang]([http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AK9VF30AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)) on projects related to Efficient AI.

My research is centered around AI4Psychology, Efficient AI, Multimodal AI, Generative AI, and Spatial Intelligence.

💡 I thrive on curiosity and am always eager to tackle ambitious challenges. If you’re working on exciting AI problems, I’d love to connect and collaborate!
