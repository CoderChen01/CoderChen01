# Hi there, I’m Junjie (Jorji) Chen (陈俊杰) 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I am currently a third-year master’s student at **Anhui Polytechnic University (AHPU)**, supervised by **Prof. Subin Huang**.  
My hometown is [Lu’an, Anhui, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu%27an).

I am a **Research Intern** at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence,  
[Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hefei),  
supervised by **Prof. [Meng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rHagaaIAAAAJ&hl=en)**,  
and I plan to apply for **PhD studies in Fall 2026**.

I am also a **Research Assistant** working with  
**[Linfeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AK9VF30AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)**  
on topics related to **Efficient AI**.

💡 I am broadly interested in understanding how AI systems can better model human psychological and emotional states, and how such understanding can be incorporated into practical and efficient interactive systems.

## 🎯 Research Focus

I am primarily interested in the following research question:

> **How can we build psychologically grounded, fine-grained, multimodal, and efficient conversational AI systems that better understand and respond to human emotions?**

In particular, I am learning and exploring:
- 🧠 **Psychology-informed modeling** of emotion and cognition in dialogue systems.
- 🎭 **Fine-grained emotion perception**, including subtle, dynamic, and context-dependent affect.
- 🔊🖼️ **Multimodal interaction**, combining language with visual, acoustic, and behavioral cues.
- ⚡ **Efficiency-aware methods** for building deployable and scalable dialogue models.

My goal is to gradually develop dialogue systems that can align more closely with human affective and cognitive processes, rather than relying on coarse or surface-level emotional signals.

## 🔬 Research Interests

The following areas reflect my **current interests and learning directions**, which support the above research focus:

- 🧠 **AI4Psychology**  
  Computational approaches to modeling psychological processes.

- ⚡ **Efficient AI**  
  Model compression, acceleration, and efficiency-oriented learning.

- 🎭 **Multimodal AI**  
  Representation learning and fusion across multiple modalities.

- 🖌️ **Generative AI**  
  Controlled and interpretable generation for dialogue and simulation.

- 🧭 **Spatial Intelligence**  
  Embodied and environment-aware reasoning related to interaction and behavior.

These directions are not independent goals, but are explored as part of a broader effort to understand and build psychologically informed conversational AI.

## 💬 Let’s Collaborate!

I am always happy to learn from and collaborate with researchers interested in:
- Emotion and affect modeling grounded in psychology
- Multimodal dialogue systems
- Efficient and practical conversational AI

If our interests overlap, I would be glad to connect and exchange ideas.
