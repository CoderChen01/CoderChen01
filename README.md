# Hi there, I'm Junjie (Jorji) Chen (陈俊杰) 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I am currently a second-year master’s student at **Anhui Polytechnic University (AHPU)**, under the supervision of **Prof. Subin Huang**. My research is centered around **Efficient AI**, **Multimodal Learning**, **Generative AI**, and **Spatial Intelligence**.

🌱 I am passionate about building intelligent systems that are both **powerful** and **practical**, with a focus on optimizing efficiency, cross-modal understanding, and real-world deployment. I'm currently a **Research Assistant** working with [**Linfeng Zhang**](http://www.zhanglinfeng.tech/) on projects related to **Efficient AI**.

💼 I also serve as a **Research Intern at TeleAI, China Telecom**, where I’m involved in projects at the intersection of AI systems, spatial reasoning, and industrial applications.

💡 I thrive on curiosity and am always eager to tackle ambitious challenges. If you're working on exciting AI problems, I'd love to connect and collaborate!
